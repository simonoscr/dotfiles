## Intro

Hello and welcome to my NixOS setup. Please be aware that I'm still in the early stages of learning all this. The setup here was created with the help of multiple examples and inspiration from other dotfile and nix-config repositories (see [Credits](https://gitlab.com/simonoscr/nixfiles#credits)).

Feel free to borrow ideas from my configurations, but keep in mind that they might not always represent the best or most correct approach and make sure you've grasped the basics of NixOS, Nix, Flakes, and Home-Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a work in progress, and I'm constantly learning more about NixOS, Nix, Flakes, and Home-Manager.

## Features

- **nix-flake**: Manage NixOS and Home-Manager configurations.

- **flake-parts**: A good way to manage flake with less boilerplate.

- **home-manager**: Manage your dotfiles, home environment, and user-specific configurations with Home Manager.

- **nh**: "yet-another-nix-helper". NH reimplements some basic nix commands. Adding functionality on top of the existing solutions, like nixos-rebuild, home-manager cli or nix itself.

- **NixVim**: Nix Flake Neovim


## :snowflake: Repo Layout

- **docs**: This folder contains different README files. Like a little wiki but not really structured. Sorry.

- **home**: This folder contains configurations for home-manager. In the profiles subfolder are the differenct home-manager profiles. Here i have everything user related in it.

- **hosts**: The hosts/ folder helps me organize my different hosts. At the moment there are two hosts: My Desktop PC and my Home-Server.

- **system**: This folder contains everything thats is nixos related. Like program, service, network and nix configuration itself. Like the counterpart of the home/ folder for system-wide things.

## Credits

My repository is inspired by a diverse range of dotfiles and nix-configurations repositories across GitHub, GitLab (and maybe Codeberg). While I've gathered ideas from numerous places, there are a few key repositories that significantly influenced this repository:

- [fufexan Dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles)
  - helped me very much to find a good repository structure and also good and clean .nix configurations
- [Matt Dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/usmcamp0811/dotfiles)
  - also borrowed a little structure and content of .nix files
- [ryan4yin nix-config](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config)
  - helped me a lot for server related configurations
- [Aylur dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles)
  - thank you very much for ags config
